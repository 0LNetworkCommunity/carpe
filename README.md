## Getting Started

### Creating Your First Account

Like any account-based blockchain, new account addresses created in Carpe will initially be inactive. Your account becomes active only after someone sends at least one coin to it. Until this happens, your account does not exist "on-chain."

If you don't know anyone on the OpenLibra network yet, join our Discord community where many members are happy to help onboard new users. The app will also guide you through the process.
