# Carpe - The 0L Desktop Wallet and Miner

This desktop app connects to the 0L network and lets you create accounts, do some account management, and also participate in the network by mining coins. To learn more about 0L itself follow the link: [0L introduction](https://github.com/OLSF/libra#readme).

Like any account-based blockchain, any new account address you create in the Carpe app will be inactive (will not exist on the chain). For the account to become active, someone needs to send you at least one coin to it. Until that happens your account does not exist "on chain". If you don't know anyone yet on 0L, come into the Discord chat and just ask anyone there. Many people will be happy to help get you onboarded. Otherwise the app should guide you through it.
