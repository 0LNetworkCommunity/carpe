# Carpe - The OpenLibra Desktop Wallet

Carpe is a desktop wallet application that connects to the OpenLibra network, enabling you to create accounts and manage your coins. To learn more about the OpenLibra network itself, visit the [official OpenLibra Network website](https://openlibra.io/).

## Download the App

Currently, Windows and macOS are supported:

- **Windows 10+**: [Download Carpe for Windows](https://github.com/0LNetworkCommunity/carpe/releases/download/v1.0.7/carpe_1.0.7_x64_en-US.msi)
- **macOS 11+**: [Download Carpe for macOS](https://github.com/0LNetworkCommunity/carpe/releases/download/v1.0.7/carpe_1.0.7_x64.dmg)

## Getting Started

### Creating Your First Account

Like any account-based blockchain, new account addresses created in Carpe will initially be inactive. Your account becomes active only after someone sends at least one coin to it. Until this happens, your account does not exist "on-chain."

If you don't know anyone on the OpenLibra network yet, join our Discord community where many members are happy to help onboard new users. The app will also guide you through the process.
