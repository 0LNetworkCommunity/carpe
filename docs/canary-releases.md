# Canary Releases

If you are adventurous an want to be on the cutting edge of Carpe releases, you can download Carpe Canary.

Canary version allows you to have both installations side-by-side without interfering with each other. So you can have separate accounts, and separate mining. Or even keep one for running on testnet and the other on mainnet. App data will be stored at `[HOME]/0L_CANARY`.

Canary versions will receive Over-The-Air updates just like the production version.
