# Carpe Canary Releases

If you're adventurous and want to experience the cutting edge of Carpe development, you can download Carpe Canary.

## What is Carpe Canary?

Carpe Canary is our pre-release testing channel that allows you to:

- **Run alongside the stable version**: Both installations can coexist without interfering with each other
- **Maintain separate accounts**: Keep distinct configurations for testing
- **Use different networks**: Run one version on testnet and another on mainnet
- **Access early features**: Test new functionality before it reaches the stable release

## Installation Details

- **Data storage**: Canary app data is stored separately at `[HOME]/0L_CANARY`
- **Automatic updates**: Canary versions receive Over-The-Air updates just like the production version
- **Independent operation**: Your existing Carpe installation remains unaffected

**Note**: Canary releases may contain experimental features and could be less stable than production releases. Use with appropriate caution.
