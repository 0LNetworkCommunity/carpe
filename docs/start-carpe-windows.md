# Carpe for windows

## Download the latest version

You can find the Windows 10 installer in the releases folder:

https://github.com/OLSF/carpe/releases/download/v0.3.0/carpe_0.3.0_x64.msi


# Important:
On Windows, currently, Microsoft Edge WebView2 must be installed manually first. We're sorting this out :). For now download that dependency here:
https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/consumer



After installation and start, continue with [usage of carpe](usage.md).
