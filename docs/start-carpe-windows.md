# Carpe for windows

## Download the latest version

You can find the Windows 10 installer in the releases folder:

[https://github.com/OLSF/carpe/releases/download/v0.3.0/carpe_0.3.0_x64.msi](https://github.com/0LNetworkCommunity/carpe/releases/download/v1.0.7/carpe_1.0.7_x64_en-US.msi)

# Important:

On Windows, currently, Microsoft Edge WebView2 must be installed manually first. We're sorting this out :). For now download that dependency here:
https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/consumer

After installation and start, continue with [usage of carpe](usage.md).
