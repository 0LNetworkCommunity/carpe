# Usage of carpe

## Initial start
After successful installation and first start, you should see an initial screen, which let's you create your account:

### Create an account

If this is your first usage, you should just click on "new account" and then on "generate keys". You can click on "generate keys" as often as you like until you are happy with the proposed account number.

Then please write down the ACCOUNT ADDRESS, AUTH KEY and the RECOVERY PHRASE. 

This is essential, as otherwise you will very likely loose your earned coins.

After writing this down, click on "submit". 

### Wait for account creation on chain

Until you can use the just created account, you need some 0L user who "onboards" you. Please send the displayed authkey to this person. 

After the onboarding transaction has been done, the wallet will show some BALANCE for your account and no longer the text "Account not on chain".

### Mining

After your account has been onboarded, new menus appear on top of the screen. Switch to "MINER" to earn coins.

To start mining, just click on the red toggle button, so it turns into green color.

### DANGER

There are some dangerous buttons on the "TRANSACTIONS" and "SETTINGS" screens. Don't use them until you know what they do.
