# Carpe for mac

## Download the latest version

You can find the installable mac package in the releases folder:

macOS version 10.15 or higher
https://github.com/OLSF/carpe/releases/download/v0.0.1.5/carpe_0.0.1.5_x64.dmg

Note: while the app is in early beta status, you'll have to override the trusted developer settings on your Mac in order to run an install the app. The code is open source, so you can double check if we are doing anything sneaky.

After installation and start, continue with [usage of carpe](usage.md).
