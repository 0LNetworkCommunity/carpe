# Carpe for macOS

## System Requirements

- **macOS 10.15 or higher**

## Download and Installation

You can download the latest macOS installer from our releases page:

**[Download Carpe for macOS](https://github.com/0LNetworkCommunity/carpe/releases/download/v1.0.7/carpe_1.0.7_x64.dmg)**

## Important: App Permissions

Since Carpe is currently in early beta, you'll need to override the default trusted developer settings on your Mac to install and run the application.

**Why this is necessary**: The code is completely open source, so you can verify that we're not doing anything malicious. This security warning is simply because we haven't yet gone through Apple's notarization process.

### Steps to Allow Installation:
1. Download the `.dmg` file from the link above
2. Open the downloaded file
3. If macOS prevents installation, go to **System Preferences > Security & Privacy**
4. Click "Allow" next to the Carpe app notification

## Next Steps

After successful installation and launch, continue with our [Carpe Usage Guide](usage.md) to get started.
